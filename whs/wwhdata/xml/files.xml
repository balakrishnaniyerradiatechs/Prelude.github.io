    <Document title="The Warehousing module was designed to process transactions more efficiently and with a greater level of accuracy with and without Radio Frequency (RF) units. Bin level allocation programs are available for sales orders, stock transfers, work orders, and bin replenishments. Lot controlled products are committed at the lot level. The allocation routine determines the remaining bin available quantity by using the current bin onhand quantity less the committed quantity. For example, bin level commitments are maintained allowing a bin available evaluation during transaction processing. Once inventory in a bin is completely committed then the next available bin is committed for subsequent transactions." href="opt_whs.1.1.htm" />
