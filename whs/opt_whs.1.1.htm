    <title>The Warehousing module was designed to process transactions more efficiently and with a greater level of accuracy with and without Radio Frequency (RF) units. Bin level allocation programs are available for sales orders, stock transfers, work orders, and bin replenishments. Lot controlled products are committed at the lot level. The allocation routine determines the remaining bin available quantity by using the current bin onhand quantity less the committed quantity. For example, bin level commitments are maintained allowing a bin available evaluation during transaction processing. Once inventory in a bin is completely committed then the next available bin is committed for subsequent transactions.</title>

A product / bin inquiry done at any time shows the current status of each bin; onhands, commitments and available. The RF functions are based on a queue philosophy where you can request the number of items to work on. The Bin Queue is the work file for RF transactions. Transaction type, date and bin sort sequence maintain this file in a logical sequence for RF picking. Each RF document picking process has a manual version to be used as a backup method in case an RF unit fails. Once you request transactions to process, a report is printed with the product information. Terminal entry can be done for confirmation.  </div>
