      <div class="Body"><a name="1001201">Activity Based Costing (ABC) is one of the newer, frequently used “buzz words” in the </a>Distribution Industry. Whereas everyone believes it is a wonderful concept, no two businesses can agree on implementation and use. Activant has defined an initial set of guidelines to begin the process of providing to our customers the ability to use ABC in their work environment. This, by no stretch of the imagination, is the final result of our efforts, as this will be an ever-evolving product in Prelude.</div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1001202">ABC, simply defined, is the ability to measure costs in your business that are not normally </a>defined, measured (and are definitely too difficult to measure without a computer system) or assigned to typical general ledger accounts. These are costs associated with activities performed within your business. The difficulty behind implementing ABC is being able to define those costs within your business that drive your business and capturing all possible activities that apply to those costs. That is usually what puts a project like ABC on hold within a company because many people have to evaluate and analyze these activities and assign costs, which becomes a major undertaking by multiple people within the company. Simply put: IT’S A LOT OF WORK!</div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1001203">The steps involved in implementing ABC into your business begin with the analysis phase. </a>This is probably the most difficult part of the process as it involves identifying resources, functions, activities, tasks, processes, and finally cost drivers in your business. </div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1001204">Resources are people, equipment, technology, space, supplies, etc. Functions are related </a>activities performed by a group of people with common responsibility (i.e. delivery, warehouse handling, outside sales, inside sales). Activities are descriptions of what each function does (i.e. deliver product, make sales calls, take orders, etc.). Tasks are the steps required to perform an activity (i.e. load the truck, fuel the truck, unload the truck, etc.). Processes are related activities trying to accomplish a goal (i.e. processing an order, processing a purchase order, etc.). And finally, Cost Drivers are factors that influence cost (i.e. delivery costs are affected by the number of stops, warehouse handling costs are affected by the number of pieces, etc.)</div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1001205">Once all of the analysis is finished and the above areas have been defined, then the final </a>activity unit costs can be calculated. That is where our system enters the picture. We allow the user to define several different activity unit costs and then we begin tracking the factors associated with those activity costs. </div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1001206">Our system revolves around five inquiries and reports that provide vital information to a </a>company regarding the profitability of customers, products, vendors, product lines, and vendor lines. Once we provide that data to our clients, it is up to them to analyze the data and determine if a customer, vendor, product, product line, or vendor line that is not profitable can be made profitable. If the determination is made that the customer, vendor, product, product line or vendor line cannot be made profitable, then the decision is made whether to fire that customer or vendor or drop that product, product line or vendor line. </div>
