If an alternative product does not exist for a 13 digit barcode that is scanned, the user will be prompted with the message Product Does Not Exist! Set Up as Alternate Product?. If the user selects Y, the RF ADD screen will then be displayed, allowing the user to enter the ADS stocking product number that is to be updated as an alternate product with the barcode number scanned  in Product Maintenance. Therefore, ensuring that this product will be recognized as an alternate product when scanned in the future. Once the product number is entered, and if alternate products currently exist, the Alternates field will then display the first alternate product listed for this product. If multiple alternates exist, the down arrow key can be used to move through the list of alternates. Once the Alternate number was selected, the remaining information pertaining to this alternate can then be entered. The UPC field is a Y/N flag that determined if this product should be identified as a UPC code. The UCC flag determines if this alternate should be established as a UCC Code. This code can be identified as a M-Master Pack, P- Pallet Pack, S-Shelf Pack, or select N to not update this product as an UCC code. If something other than N is selected for the UCC flag, the user will then be prompted to enter additional UCC information. Enter the quantity of items for this UCC Code in the UCC Qty field. This quantity will automatically be defaulted to the Serial Ship Container Entry for label printing purposes. Next, the user will then be required to enter the Unit of Measure in the U/M field. The user is then brought in to the Cat ID field to enter a valid Catalog id code for this product. The Alt Ppg field requires that the associated alternate product price group to be entered for this UCC code in this field. In addition to this screen, the option of adding UCC Codes on the fly was added to several other screens as well.
