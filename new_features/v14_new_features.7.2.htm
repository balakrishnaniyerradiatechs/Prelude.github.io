The manufacturer rep order is entered to recognize the request. This type order is processed similar to a type 04 direct order except this type order only updates sales information; customer sales and sales analysis. It is handled similar to a direct order in that no inventory commitments are made for the items on the order but the order will still appear in Inventory Inquiry until the order is billed. Unlike a direct order, accounts receivable is not affected by this type order. Special manufacturer rep accounts must be established in the General Ledger Table before utilizing this feature.

This insures that a customers accounting code is entered correctly in sales order entry and quote order entry by checking a list of customer specified account code patterns for a match. Installing patterns in a customer’s record informs the system that any customer account code entered in sales order entry or quote order entry must be validated as a correct pattern. The <span class="Italics">Require Acct Code</span> field must be set to Y to access the screen where these codes are entered. After that you may turn the field off if the customer does not require an accounting code on every order but still perform pattern matching should the operator enter an accounting code. This means that pattern matching can be performed with or without requiring the accounting code to be entered. Patterns may include alpha, numeric, both alpha and number, dashes, and strings. Though unlimited patterns may be entered, only one pattern should be entered per line. Patterns may be entered in using the standard PICK pattern matching methodology.

If the Ship-To record does not contain a language code, the Language Indicator from the customer record is used. For example: a Canadian customer needs to see product descriptions in French but they have one location that needs to see descriptions in English. That location is set up with the English language code and the other ship-to locations are left blank which means they will see descriptions in French as defined by the language code in the customer record. See Inventory Product Maintenance; and Order Processing Customer Maintenance, Sales Order Entry, and Quotation Entry.</div>

User is prompted for a customer number, rebate program number, rebate period (<span class="Italics">Credit Report Freq</span>), and a range of invoice dates. The rebate period and date range must be entered. User is also prompted for a report description that will print on the report. This allows you to define in more detail, what the report is for. This does not replace the report description but allows you to add to it. For example, the standard report description is Customer Rebate Summary Report. You could set this field to 1998 IHS Rebates – Summary. This would print on the fourth line of the header. This report displays for each customer the total amount for all invoices, total of merchandise amounts, total of amounts eligible for a rebate, total of amounts paid  in the <span class="Italics">Eligible Days to Pay</span> days from the Invoice Date, total of amounts paid after the <span class="Italics">Eligible Days to Pay</span> days from the Invoice Date has passed, total unpaid balance, and the total rebate amount. This report sorts and breaks by customer name. See Order Processing Invoice Processing and Accounts Receivable Cash Receipts Entry for more information.</div>

              <div class="Bullet_inner"><span class="Italics"><a name="1001170">Core Returns Due Aging Report</a></span> is a new report that displays pending cores that have not been received yet. It gives the user an idea as to what they have remaining to be returned and when it is expected to come in. This report prompts for a customer range, As Of date, and/or Core Code. If a customer range is not entered then all customers will be selected. The report displays when the cores are due or how long they are past due based on the due date relative to the entered As Of date. In other words, the data is put in the appropriate columns based on the <span class="Italics">As of Date</span> entered at run time and the <span class="Italics">Due Date </span>of the cores. For example, if a pending core record’s <span class="Italics">Due Date</span> is 9/1/99 and you enter an <span class="Italics">As Of Date</span> of 7/15/99 then the item would appear in the Future 31-60 bucket. But if you enter an <span class="Italics">As Of Date</span> of 8/15/99 then the item would appear in the Current bucket. Likewise, if 10/15/99 were entered, the item would appear in the Past Due 31-60 bucket. This report sorts by customer by core type code by product number and page breaks on customer.
