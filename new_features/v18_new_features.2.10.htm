      <div class="Body"><a name="1002465">The functionality of </a><span class="Italics">the Customer P/O#</span> field was updated to accommodate the new E Administrative Order Hold type. Versions 18 &amp; higher were enhanced with a new Administrative Order Hold process that will place orders on hold that exceed the pre-determined blanket purchase order amount. This update works with the new E AOH type <span class="Italics">(Referenced in the Systems New Features list)</span> as well as the new <span class="Italics">P/O Customer #</span> field in the Require P/O Number screen in Customer Maintenance. Once a customer number is entered in the Customer P/O# field, the system will review this customer's blanket p/o information. The F3-Look up option is also available to display all the blanket P/Os for this customer to allow you to select one if multiple blanket P/Os exist. If the total dollar amount of the items entered on the sales order exceed the amount available on the blanket P/O, the message Order was Placed on Administrative Hold! is displayed after you select Pick Ticket.

      <div class="Subhead"><a name="1002466">New Auto Cancellation Date Field</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1002467">The Sales Order Entry screen was updated with a new </a><span class="Italics">Auto Cancellation Date</span> field. This new feature provides users with the capability of entering a date that will be evaluated during Nightly Processing when the date is reached, therefore, determining if this order should be cancelled. Each line on the sales order will be assessed separately and cancelled if no linkages or pick quantities currently exist. This option is primarily beneficial for canceling sales orders that contain items on backorder. In addition, an <span class="Italics">Auto </span><span class="Italics">Cancellation Date</span> field has also been added to the F5-Add Info screen at the Line Item level. This allows users to establish cancellation dates for each line item. The date at the Line Item level will override the date entered at the header level. However, if the cancellation date is null at the line item level, the date set up at the header level will be used. With this new option, several updates throughout the system have also been made to incorporate this feature. The logic in the Nightly Processing routine was modified to accommodate this new auto cancel option. The Monthly Lost Sales and Monthly Lost Sales By Vendor reports were updated to include a CD lost sales reason code to identify which sales were lost due to the Auto Cancellation Date process.<span class="Italics"> </span>The Sales Order Log Inquiry has also been updated with a new CAN code. This code will be displayed indicating that a line item was deleted during the Nightly Processing routine due to the auto cancellation date. The Reference column in the Order Log Inquiry will display the product number that was deleted. In addition, the Order Log Inquiry will also display DEL indicating that the entire sales order was deleted due to the auto cancellation date. The Reference column will be updated with the Auto B/O Cancellation reference. </div>

The new Return To Product option takes the user to the first occurrence of the product number and removes the duplicate product number.</div>
      <div class="Subhead"><a name="1002471">Updated A/R Terms Functionality In Sales Order Entry</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1002472">The completion screen in Sales Order Entry was modified with a new feature. This applies </a>to customers associated with an A/R Terms code that have the Deposit Required flag set to Y. The Deposit Required flag is a new flag that was added to the A/R Terms Code screen in the Customer Control Files option. If a sales order is entered for a customer that currently is attached to an A/R terms with the Deposit Required flag set to Y and the Acknowledge Flag is not set to Print, Fax or E-mail.

      <div class="Body"><a name="1002478">The completion screen in Sales Order Entry was updated with a new Currency </a>Conversion screen to allow you to automatically convert the US dollar amounts entered for additional charges to the correct currency type for this customer. This new option simplifies the process of applying additional charges such as Inbound and Outbound freight, Handling, Delivery, Pickup, Restock, or Minimum charges to an order that is not currently associated with a US currency customer. When entering additional charges on an order for a non-US currency customer, the user can select the Currency Conversion option this screen will display the currency rate for this customer. The user then has the ability of entering the dollar amounts in US currency for each of the additional charges that apply. Once completed, select F2 to convert the amounts entered to the correct currency for this customer. If changes need to be made to the amounts once they were converted, the user can simply select the conversion process again and re-enter the amounts. After the F2-Save option is selected, the completion screen will be updated with the modified dollar amounts. </div>
