If one is found, the system will next determine the fiscal period to post to on the fiscal account. This is accomplished by determining the fiscal period on the live account and then checking the cross-reference fiscal period table for the fiscal account to determine the corresponding fiscal period. If that fiscal period is closed, the system will determine the next available fiscal period to post to. The system then posts the transaction to the live account and copies the transaction to the appropriate fiscal account with the correct fiscal period for that fiscal account. For example, the <span class="Italics">Separate Fiscal</span> field for location 10 is set to MAR. A transaction for warehouse 10 with a fiscal period of 99-05 will post on the live account to fiscal period 99-05 (if open) and a copy of the transaction is made in the MAR fiscal account with a fiscal period of 99-08.</div>

For Unidata clients, when the G/L Balances Postings are run on the live account, the system will spawn off phantom processes that run the G/L Balances Postings on the fiscal accounts.
