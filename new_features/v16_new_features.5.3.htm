The Pay On Receipt flag can be set to Y, N or A to determine if the system will provide the user the ability to enter necessary information that will allow the Vendor Invoice Reconciliation Entry process to be performed behind the scenes for stock receipts. If this flag is set to Y or A the system will prompt the user  in Stock Receipts Entry to enter the Pay On Receipt information such as invoice number, invoice date, period date, and freight amount.

It will be necessary for the user to either run the Pay On Receipt Vendor Mass Update process or enter Vendor Invoice Reconciliation for each receiver to process the vendor invoice.
