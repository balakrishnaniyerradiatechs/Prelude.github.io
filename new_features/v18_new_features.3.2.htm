This modification was made to provide more informative messages during check printing if the incorrect stationary is chosen. In addition, another change was made to not allow a user id to print checks if a user id is not a member of the Unix printq group. The administrator would have to make the change in Unix for the user to be setup in the Unix printq group to print checks. Previously, the stationery message that appeared before printing was basically ignored and the enable/disable messages would appear on the screen at the end of the print job for checks. </div>
      <div class="Subhead"><a name="1002079">New Batch Type Flag</a></div>
      <div class="Body"><a name="1002080">A new Batch Type C was added for credit card payments. If Batch Type is set to C, the </a>system prompts for the A/P account for use with the g/l posting of the credit card payment. Also, the system ONLY checks for invoices with status set to C (credit card) when using the F5-Auto Select option to select available invoices for payment. When F8 is selected to print checks, the system does not print any actual checks to the printer. The system updates the invoices as paid and creates a new invoice for the total amount of all invoices paid for the CC Payment Vendor. The check number begins with a C prefix followed by the next available check number using an internal sequential counter. The format for the invoice number is as follows: C/C.PAID|check number (C/C.PAID|27 as an example). The system updates notes for the original invoices paid off as well as the new invoice created for the CC Payment Vendor for reference. The system does not allow the invoices paid off with the credit card to be voided. The user will have to manually delete the new invoice created for the CC Payment Vendor. It is recommended to setup a bank code (VISA for example) for use with the A/P Credit Card Clearing account to keep the g/l postings of credit card payments separate from the regular a/p payments. When using the F5-Auto Select option to select available invoices for payment, the system recognizes the original invoices paid off that were voided and setup for payment again.</div>
